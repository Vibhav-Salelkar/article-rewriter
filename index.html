            <h4>About Us</h4>
            <p>In the SEO world and in certain academic environments, there is a need to take a chunck of text and rewrite it in a slightly different form. This practice is called Article spinning. Our article rewriter uses the synonym lookup to rewrite the given article. The result may not be in a polished state, but hey it is just fun right?</p>
